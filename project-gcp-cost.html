            <h1>DevOps Project: GCP Compute Cost Calculation with Docker and GitHub Actions</h1>

            <p>This project is focused on cost management for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance types. It involves the creation of a GitHub Actions pipeline, using Docker containers to access the Infracost API and calculate monthly prices for a specific GCP instance type.</p>

            <p>The Docker setup involved two services, service1 and service2, running in separate containers. Docker Compose was utilized for data sharing between these services. Bash scripts (fetch_price.sh and calculate_costs.sh) were used to fetch pricing data and perform the calculations.</p>

            <p>GitHub Actions Pipeline is triggered on each main branch push, and includes steps for code checkout, building and running Docker services, setting cost values, and generating a summary output.</p>

                <li>üöÄ This project showcases a robust DevOps pipeline, integrating Docker, GitHub Actions, and the Infracost API for dynamic cost calculation.</li>
                <li>üîç It highlights the potential improvements including error handling, efficiency optimization, and flexibility of input values.</li>
                <li>üåê The implementation can be extended to other cloud providers and instance types, demonstrating the project's scalability.</li>
