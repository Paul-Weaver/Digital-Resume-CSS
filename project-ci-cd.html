            <h1>DevOps Project: GoLang Server Deployment with CI/CD Pipeline</h1>

            <ul>

            <p>This project displays my DevOps knowledge by deploying a GoLang server with an automated CI/CD pipeline, realized through GitHub Actions and AWS services. The server code is a simple web application that listens on port 8080 and responds with "Hello, world!" when accessed.</p>

            <p>Upon each push to any branch except the main, the first GitHub workflow is triggered, performing code linting using golangci-lint and running tests across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows platforms with Go versions 1.15.x, 1.16.x, and 1.17.x.</p>

            <p>When a pull request is merged into the main branch, the second GitHub workflow initiates. This workflow builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile, pushes it to DockerHub, deploys the new version to Elastic Beanstalk, and conducts a smoke test to ensure the server's successful deployment.</p>

                <li>üèóÔ∏è This project embodies a typical DevOps workflow, demonstrating skills in automation, cloud services, version control, and deployment best practices.</li>
                <li>üß™ The use of GitHub Actions for testing and Elastic Beanstalk for deployment illustrates an effective CI/CD pipeline.</li>
                <li>üöÄ Key improvements like automated code review, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and performance testing elevate code quality, reproducible infrastructure, and application performance.</li>
